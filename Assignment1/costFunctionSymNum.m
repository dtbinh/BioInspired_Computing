% Assignment 1 - Implementation of benchmark cost functions.
%
% Function parameters: 
% functionName - The function name as a string.
% dimension - The search space dimension.
% range - The search space ranges as a vector of ith dimension of vectors [begin, end]
% npoints - The number points;
% Function results:
% searchSpace - As a vector;
% functionResults - As a vector;
